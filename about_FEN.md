## What is FEN ?
FEN is Forsyth-Edwards Notation.
- it represents a specific position on a chessboard.
- Here's the interpretation.
- Example:
  + `r6k/ppp3pp/3pQr2/4P3/3PK3/8/P5qP/R6R w - - 2 21`
  + Each character represents a square on the board, with lower-case letters representing black pieces and upper-case letters representing white pieces. Here's what each letter represents:
    * `r`: black rook
    * `k`: black king
    * `p`: black pawn
    * `3`: empty squares (three consecutive empty squares represent 3)
    * `P`: white pawn
    * `Q`: white queen
    * `R`: white rook
  + the number after the FEN string (`w`) indicates that it is white's turn to move.
  + the numbers `2 21` represent the half-move clock and full-move respectively.
    * which are typically used in chess notation, but may not be relevant for this specific position.

### Considerations about this particular FEN position
To understand the position and potential moves, it's crucial to consider the positional dynamics and tactical possibilities.
From the given position, it seems to be a chess problem or a specific position from a game.
White has a material advantage with an extra queen compared to black.
However, white's king seems to be in a slightly exposed position due to the black queen's pressure on the h-file.
White was actually going to loose the queen, that is why the oponent has resigned.
